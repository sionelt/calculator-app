6.check for empty array:
if (!Array.isArray(array) || !array.length) {
  // array does not exist, is not an array, or is empty
}
To break it down:

Array.isArray(), unsurprisingly, checks whether its argument is an array. This weeds out values like null, undefined and anything else that is not an array.
Note that this will also eliminate array-like objects, such as the arguments object and DOM NodeList objects. Depending on your situation, this might not be the behavior you're after.
The array.length condition checks whether the variable's length property evaluates to a truthy value. Because the previous condition already established that we are indeed dealing with an array, more strict comparisons like array.length != 0 or array.length !== 0 are not required here.

6.auto scroll to end of the top view when overflow:
overflow-x scroll and direction: rtl meaning right to left.
